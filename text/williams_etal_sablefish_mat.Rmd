# Introduction  

The Pacific Sablefish Transboundary Assessment Team (PSTAT), in collaboration with the Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC), Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC), Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G), Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC), and North Pacific Fishery Management Council (NPFMC), is developing a range-wide sablefish management strategy evaluation (MSE). 
One component of this work is the development of a set of operating models (OM) for use in the MSE that are spatially explicit [@Fenske2019]. 
When incorporating spatial complexity into a fishery stock assessment or OM it is important that the population dynamics models accurately reflect reproductive potential [@Begg2005] such as maturity [@Cadrin2020]. 
Given that sablefish exhibit spatially-varying growth [@Kapur2020] and maturity [@Rodgveller2018; @Head2020] it is necessary to align an understanding of sablefish maturity with proposed OMs. 
The connectivity of this spatially-varying maturity is unclear, though it presents as temporally persistent patterns across the geographic range. 

The objective of this analysis was to provide maturity-at-age for a suite of OMs for the PSTAT assessment. 
To do so two population spatial structures were examined with varying levels of spatial variability incorporated into the models. 
A panmictic spatial structure (PSS) was considered where maturity was modeled as a simple function of age or age and length, without regard to spatial dynamics.
A growth-informed spatial structure (GSS) was examined, the GSS is aligned with the OM being developed for the coastwide MSE (Kapur et al. *In Prep*). 
The spatial structure is a variant of different growth regions presented in @Kapur2020, with the variation being a combining of a small region in BC with surrounding larger areas. 
A third spatial structure that coincides with the status quo approach (i.e. Alaska, BC, West Coast) was considered however, histological data are not available for the BC management region at this time.


# Methods  

## Sample collection and histology  

**Could use some more input on sampling**

Macroscopic classification of female sablefish maturity can be inconsistent during some portion of a year [@Rodgveller2018], therefore only histological data were included in this analysis.
Ovary samples were collected for female sablefish from Alaska waters in 2011 and 2015 and from Washington, Oregon, and California waters in 2010, 2015, 2016, and 2018. 
Associated biological and collection information for samples included fork length (cm), weight (kg), age, maturity status, location (latitude, longitude), depth (m), and date of capture.
However, some collection information is lacking for some specimens. 
Of note is the lack of location information in 2016 for West Coast samples (Figure \@ref(fig:map)), and depth information in Alaska is binned (Figure \@ref(fig:depth)).

## Analysis

To reduce complexity, examinations were constrained to models that can provide an estimate of maturity-at-age. 
Two population spatial structures were examined with varying levels of covariates incorporated into the models. 
These population structures were designed to coincide with potential spatial structures used in proposed OMs.  
A panmictic spatial structure (PSS) approach assumes that the parameters that determine maturity are constant regardless of location. 

Two PSS models were considered:

\begin{equation}
\hat{M}_a = f_1(age)
(\#eq:eqn1)
\end{equation}

and 

\begin{equation}
\hat{M}_a = f_1(age) + f_2(length).
(\#eq:eqn2)
\end{equation}

A growth-informed spatial structure (GSS) was also examined, the GSS is aligned with regional breaks in the OM being developed for the coastwide MSE (Kapur et al. *In prep*). 
The spatial structure is a slight variant of the growth regions presented in [@Kapur2020], with the variation being a combining of a small region in BC with surrounding larger areas. 

The global GSS model was: 

\begin{equation}
  \hat{M}_a = f_1(age) + f_1(length) + f_2(location, by=Region) + f_3(depth) + Region + \epsilon. 
  (\#eq:eqn3)
\end{equation}

Age, length, location (lat/long), and depth were included as continuous variables. 
The number of knots for age, length, and depth were constrained to a maximum of 4. 
Region was included as a factor.
A total of seven models were examined.
Maturity model identifiers are as follows:

\begin{align}
ma & = age \\
mal & = age + length \\
mar & = age + region \\
marl & = age + region + length \\
mard & = age + region + depth \\
marld & = age + region + length + depth \\
marlld & = age + region + length + location + depth. \\
\end{align}



For prediction purposed the median location and depth values were used and size at age $L_a$ was estimated using the @Schute1981 formulation of the von Bertalanffy growth function. 

\begin{equation}
 L_a = L_\infty + (L_1 - L_\infty) (e^{-\kappa_\gamma age})
 (\#eq:eqn4)
\end{equation}

Where $\gamma$ is a region specific modifier of $\kappa$ to account for the timing of maturity.
Regional model parameterizations from [@Kapur2020] were optimized on regional maturity data to determine region specific $\gamma$ values. 

# Results  

Both AIC and BIC identify some of the more complex models as the most informative (Table 1).
The majority of the models describe maturity in a similar fashion, particularly for Regions 3 & 4 (Figure 3). 
The main exception is a simple age-based maturity schedule, which is particularly different for Region 1 (Figure 3). 
Of note is the decrease in predicted maturity for ages between ~20-35 (Figure 3), this type of trend can often be assigned to a small sample size, mis-classified maturity, or skip spawning. 
As these samples were evaluated histologically, it is unlikely that they were mis-classified.



# Discussion  

As the two most parsimonious models (marl and marlld) generate similar maturity curves (Figure 4) and have similar descriptive capabilities (Table 1) using the simpler model (marl) is recommended for inclusion in an OM that accounts for regional growth differences. 


General thoughts: 

 - There are some substantial differences in the sample sizes by location, depth, age, etc. that need to be considered when examining a coastwide model; therefore I utilized generalized additive models as they deal with missing data fairly well.
 - Given the spatial differences in sablefish maturity, on both coastwide and regional scales, it would be helpful to incorporate spatial abundance estimates into the estimated maturity schedule (data weight).
 - Length at maturity is a more precise descriptor (no surprise there).
 - For the coastwide analysis it would likely be easiest to implement either a strait age at maturity schedule or a von Bertalanffy estimated conditional length at maturity.
 - It may be desirable to incorporate some of the spatial aspects that are found within each region, though the added explanatory benefits for these data appear minor.
